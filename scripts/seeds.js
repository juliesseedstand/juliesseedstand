            description: "Cosmos are annual flowers with colorful, daisy-like flowers that sit atop long, slender stems. Blooming from the summer through fall, they attract birds, bees, and butterflies to your garden. They’re grown easily from seeds and will even survive in poor soil conditions! Here’s how to grow cosmos.",
            planting: "The soil should be well-draining, but other than that, cosmos don’t need any special soil preparation. In fact, they like soil that is not too rich, as rich soil will encourage foliage at the expense of blooms. Cosmos are also tolerant of most soil pH levels but grow best in neutral to alkaline soils (pH of 7.0-7.5). <br/><br/>Cosmos can tolerate warm, dry weather very well. They are even drought-tolerant.",

            description: "Zinnias create a massive burst of color in your garden from summer through the first hard frost of fall. If you want these annuals to reseed, let the last flowers of the season mature fully. Learn more about growing and caring for zinnias.",
            planting: "Choosing a location that gets full sun (6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day) is essential to getting plentiful blooms throughout the season. Additionally, a site that offers good air circulation will help to prevent foliar diseases such as powdery mildew later in the season.<br/><br/>Zinnias are able to adapt to most soil conditions, but the ideal soil will be rich in organic matter and well-draining. Soil pH should ideally be between 5.5 and 7.5. If soil is amended with compost (humus), the flowers will grow more quickly. Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting.",
